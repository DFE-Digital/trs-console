## Tasks for using the TRS
The TRS console is being designed and built one feature at a time.

The index page includes start buttons to illustrate the flow for a feature, such as:
- view and add a mandatory qualification
- manage change requests

There are other examples that will be added which are currently in wireframes.

In future the prototype may be iterated to more fully model a database with sample data.
